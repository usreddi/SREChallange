# SREChallange

* Create and deploy a running instance of a web server using a configuration management tool of your choice. The web server should serve one page with the following content.

```
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

* Secure this application and host such that only appropriate ports are publicly exposed and any http requests are redirected to https. This should be automated using a configuration management tool of your choice and you should feel free to use a self-signed certificate for the web server.

* Develop and apply automated tests to validate the correctness of the server configuration.

* Express everything in code.

* Provide your code in a Git repository named `SREChallenge` on GitHub.com
